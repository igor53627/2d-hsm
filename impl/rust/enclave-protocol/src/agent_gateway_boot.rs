//! Agent Gateway (4b) boot WIRING (TASK-7.7 5b-2b-ii (d-ii)/4b): the live composition of the
//! TWO-artifact serve gate into the boot path — `ValidatedBootBudget::validate` (gate #2) → the shared
//! producer+transport mint `transport_with_spawn` (gate #1: the CONCRETE `HardBoundedQuoteProducer`,
//! claim + witness by signature) → `run_boot_anti_rollback_handshake` with the count derived in-body
//! from the SAME witness → `decide_serve` — plus the typed boot-event seam
//! ([`AgentBootEvent`]/[`BootLogLevel`]) that discharges the §8 two-phase config-logging obligation in
//! the LIBRARY (content + severity; the 5b-2c bin only forwards Display lines to stderr→journald,
//! mapping [`AgentBootEvent::level`] to priority). NB the fatal paths emit no DEDICATED ERROR event
//! (events emitted BEFORE the failure point still flow — they carry context, not the cause) — the
//! bin MUST also render the returned `ProtocolError` to stderr at err priority; the event seam alone
//! under-reports the most severe class (§8 (4b) re-scope item (d)). Event matrix per failure class:
//! validate `Err` ⇒ RawBudgetConfig only + the Err; claim refusal ⇒ RawBudgetConfig +
//! ValidatedBudget + the Err; driver FailClosed ⇒ all three events (HandshakeOutcome ready:false
//! carries the cause at Warn) + the folded Err; Ready-but-gate-refused (driver-bug corner) ⇒ all
//! three with ready:true + the DISTINCT gate-refusal Err — the one class where the event stream
//! reads success.
//!
//! (4b) ships the COMPOSITION, not a serving loop: nothing here is `pub`, there is no listener and no
//! bin, and live serve remains gated on the TWO-artifact gate — the (4c) in-guest aya smoke + 5b-2c
//! witness-construction-from-operator-config (§8). The module is consumer-free until the 5b-2c bin's
//! `pub` wrapper (`run_agent_gateway_boot`, §8) wraps [`run_boot_handshake_wired`] — the exact
//! precedent of `production_transport`/`production()` when (d-ii)/2+3 landed — hence the module-wide
//! allow below.
//!
//! Discharged HERE (the two §8 5b-2c preconditions named at (d-ii)/3): the DRIVER-COUNT BINDING (by
//! construction — no SEPARATE driver-count input exists; the ONE `max_attempts` input is the value
//! `validate()` blesses and the driver receives, so a second, divergent count is unrepresentable:
//! `budget.max_attempts()` is derived in-body from the same witness that minted the transport;
//! test-backed by
//! `wired_driver_count_is_the_same_witness_max_attempts`) and the TWO-PHASE LOGGING content+severity
//! (raw triplet BEFORE validate, getters incl. slack after, zero-slack ⇒ Warn — library logic, each
//! half test-pinned). Never-generic-Q containment is structural: the generic composition body is
//! module-PRIVATE and the only crate-visible wired door is the concrete [`run_boot_handshake_wired`];
//! `<Q: BootQuoteProducer>` appears nowhere (§8).
//!
//! Cfg gate: this module names `ValidatedBootBudget` + `HardBoundedQuoteProducer` (triple-gated) — the
//! cfg intersection of its dependencies, never wider (the §8 hard rule); it CANNOT be
//! agent-gateway-only. CI covers it devicelessly: the Linux
//! `cargo test --features vsock-transport,agent-gateway` lane. Cross-file references in this file are
//! plain backticks (house rule: everything referenced is same-gate or wider, so a link could never
//! dangle here — the uniform rule keeps the next editor from copying a link into a wider-gated file).
